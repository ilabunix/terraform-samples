Incident Update:

Investigation is ongoing for OCSE and OMEM emails not appearing in the FedMail monitor inbox. During the incident call, testing confirmed that emails sent to non-Microsoft mailboxes (e.g., Gmail) are being delivered successfully, while emails targeting Microsoft/Office 365 mailboxes are not consistently received.

DDS processing and outbound mail flow appear to be functioning as expected, with messages leaving DDS normally. EUS reviewed mail gateway logs and did not observe messages stuck in queues; current alerts indicating queuing may be delayed or false positives based on historical behavior.

Initial findings suggest the issue may be related to downstream email delivery or Office 365 handling rather than DDS. EUS is continuing to review specific message examples and logs to further validate behavior. No confirmed customer-facing functional impact beyond delayed or missing monitoring emails at this time.

Monitoring remains in place, and updates will be provided as additional findings become available.
