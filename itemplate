Incident Update:

As of the latest checks, mail queues are actively draining and have now cleared. OCSE and OMEM emails are once again appearing in the FedMail monitoring inbox, and FedMail PROD monitors are reporting a GREEN status.

EUS confirmed that all queued emails for FRB domains have been processed successfully. Recent test emails sent earlier in the evening were received with delay but ultimately delivered once queues cleared. Overall email flow is now functioning as expected.

The observed behavior appears consistent with a transient downstream email delivery issue, potentially related to Microsoft/Office 365 handling. No DDS processing issues were identified during this period.

Monitoring will continue to ensure stability, and the incident will remain open pending confirmation of sustained normal operations and any additional updates from Microsoft.
