Update:

Root cause identified as Salesforce Bridge being unable to connect to MQ.

The issue was related to proxy connectivity. As a workaround, application code was modified to route traffic through proxy 3 instead of proxy 1. After the change, logs show successful MQ connection.

Initial validation in UIM looks good at this time.
We are currently waiting for the FL Access team to perform functional testing and confirm end-to-end processing.

Next update will be provided after FL Access testing is completed.
