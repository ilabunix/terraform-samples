Incident Update:

WAS administrators have reverted the earlier certificate changes on the Zone 4A server and service has been restored on that node. Initial validation confirms connectivity has returned and health checks are responding as expected.

The team is now proceeding to revert the same certificate changes on Zone 5 and Zone 4B servers to ensure consistency across the environment.
