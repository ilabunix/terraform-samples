Team,

As part of the upcoming CFS2 Non-Prod Cloud Disaster Recovery Test (East region isolation), application teams have the option to participate in failover testing to the West region.

Participation is encouraged for multi-region applications to validate failover procedures and ensure applications are functioning as expected.

If a team chooses not to actively participate, please ensure someone is on alert during the exercise window and perform at least a cursory validation of the application after failover.

Note: This CDRT primarily focuses on multi-region applications. Single-region apps may have different considerations.

Please review your application architecture and confirm how your team plans to approach this exercise.
