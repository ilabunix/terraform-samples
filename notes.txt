Just to clarify on the incident we discussed on Friday — the tags were actually added while I was working the incident earlier in the week. It looks like the report didn’t pick them up for some reason, so it may have appeared like it was added last minute. I just wanted to make sure that didn’t come across as a miss on my end.
