Team,

As part of the upcoming CFS2 Non-Production Cloud Disaster Recovery Test (CDRT), the East region will be isolated during the exercise window.

Please note that application teams are not required to perform a failover to the West region as part of this test.

For multi-region applications, teams may choose to participate in failover testing if they would like to validate their recovery process.

If you do not plan to actively participate, please ensure someone from your team is available during the exercise window and perform at least a cursory validation check of your application once the failover activity occurs.

This test primarily focuses on multi-region applications. Single-region applications may experience impact during the isolation window, and teams should plan accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions or if your team plans to actively participate.
